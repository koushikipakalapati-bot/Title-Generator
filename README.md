Title Generator Using LSTM
Project Overview

This project implements a Machine Learning based Title Generator using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network.
The model learns patterns from existing titles and generates meaningful new titles based on a given seed text.

Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Google Colab

NumPy

Methodology:

Text preprocessing using tokenization

Creation of n-gram sequences

Sequence modeling using LSTM

Softmax-based next-word prediction

Features:

Generates context-aware titles

Uses deep learning for sequence prediction

Simple and lightweight dataset

Easy to run on Google Colab

Dataset:

A custom text file (titles.txt) containing sample titles related to machine learning and Python.

Applications:

Blog title generation

YouTube video titles

Content recommendation systems

NLP learning projects
